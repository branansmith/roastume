//have roasts be with amused mastery
// this is quite the resume you have here...
// java hmm.. are you planning on moving to england?
//stuff like that ^


//what if I do a remake of the resume on the webpage
//like the webpage recreates a resume with different sections
//and roasts each section
//recreates the resume part in times new roman
//roast part in sans serif or whatever the font is now
//

//linkedin post:
//think bold

//Do you ever wonder what's really wrong with your resume?

//Why you're not getting calls and simply getting ghosted?

//Me too, so I built Roastume. It won't answer either of 
//these questions
//but it will roast the shit out of your resume
//completely free of charge. 

//Just upload your resume and click go at:
//roastume.com
